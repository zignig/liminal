# What is it ? 

20250805 - this seems to be working, the notes interface needs some more work. But editing the tings that need to be done __inside__ the application is probably the way forward.

# Intent

The intent of liminal is to have a server that can store notes, data and assets.  With authentication and authorization it can share and replicate static and current data between users. 

The original intent was an asset server for [bevy](https://bevy.org/) games, however iroh provides a larger surface area.
