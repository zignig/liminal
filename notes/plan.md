# irpc service

iprc is now 0.9  , perhaps it should be integrated with the liminal gossip , so node specific stuff can be local.


This is an [irpc](https://github.com/n0-computer/irpc) service that can be used to connect to other services. 

Write and irpc service that used to get base information about [liminal](liminal) services. 

Should have the following functions.

1. Hello
1. WhatDoYouKnow
1. GotAnyFriends
1. GetSomeGossipFriends

## How to

Fren should enforce friendlyness ,  should start with **hello** , then prove your identity and then you __may__ be able to ask questions about services. A few questions should be free , and then you get blocked.

##  Thoughts

[iroh](http://iroh.computer) needs some defence against the dark arts, make it by invitation and have a way to block bad actors.
