# Replicator

The replicator is a gossip channel that is set up to act like an ethernet broadcast domain, instead of mac addresses it will collect and maintain a table of hashes vs active nodes that claim to have the blobs.

## Internal data representation

1. hash of  BlobHash -> Vector of Node ID.
1. timestamp -> BlobHash
1. timestamp -> Node

Every X seconds , go through and expire Blobs and Nodes older than a given time.

## Messages between nodes

1. WhoHas - broadcast to all nodes and query if any node has  the given hash.
1. IHave - broadcast (perhaps a unicast through a irpc binding) that returns a list of know nodes for the hash
