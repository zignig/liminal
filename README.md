# Liminal

This is some experimentation with [iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/). A p2p rust networking toolkit.

Currently it host blobs , gossip and has a web interface running [rocket](http://rocket.rs) as a web server.

The plan is to make it a game asset server, however it should be a generic blob server with some file processing capability.

As of 20250719 experiments continue....

Here we are ... 20260205 , work continues. 

Restructuring the repo , make some libraies. and put things into folders.
